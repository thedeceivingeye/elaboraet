<p ><img src="images/the-thinker2_transp.png" alt="[thinking man]" name="img1" width="128" height="131" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; border: 3px groove black;" /> I created Elaboraet to write and share my beliefs  about education and philosophy, as well as to collect and link various official intellectual resources, mainly literary works such as books, poems and other websites. You may notice that I already have started a &quot;books&quot; index linked on the main page currently containing The Lost Tools of Learning by Dorothy Sayers and How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler as of May 31. The list will grow with time. </p>

<p align="left">I will also cover other topics that relate to or supplement my main topics. One example is my wget-command.html page (located in the <em>guides</em> page) that points out how the common wget Linux tool has a powerful function to recursively mirror any website in its entirety. As I have written on the page itself, why any of this is relevant is because websites are inherently volatile and the availability of their information can never be completely relied on. Hence I urge that we should use wget to mirror websites we find valuable and, in a sense, make their information our own by guaranteeing its availability to ourselves. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Update: July 10th: </strong>This site was re-designed in Macromedia DreamWeaver 8 to make the process of adding to the website far easier, and allow myself to focus on the website's content rather than its code. To summarize the changes, although they are obvious; there is, firstly,  a new navigation bar leading to the pages of the website, on each page, with an active page's link surrounded with  arrows (see the &quot;home&quot; link). The latter was done to give the feeling of a genuine navigation bar because, in reality, it is nothing but a 1-row, several-column table. But simplicity often beats complexity, as I and many would agree. </p>

<p align="left">More on simplicity. Because of the simplicity of this website, it is  easy to design, easy to read, and will work on almost any device. Save those with tiny screens, perhaps. As long as the navigation bar shows, the site should be accessible.</p>
