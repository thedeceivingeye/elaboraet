	<p><i>Quote of the Week:</i></p>
	“You have a lot of people that grow up not having an identity. They don't know what they <i>should</i> like or not like, so they look to everybody else to follow what they're doing. [If] they see somebody that's not getting picked on, or they see somebody that's popular, they'll just emulate that other person's identity. ... [People] who grow up like this never gain the ability to form their own ideas, thoughts and opinions because they are so used to being afraid of the retaliation from other people when they say or feel 'the wrong way.' ”

	<p style="text-align:center"><b>Web News:</b> Facebook patents a technology that can track you using the <i>dust on your camera</i> as a sort of "visual fingerprint." If two people have used the same camera, Facebook would be able to link the photos based on "dust patterns" and dust pattern detection. Is this yet another leap forward into an age of no privacy? </p>
