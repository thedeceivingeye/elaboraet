<p><strong>July 16th:</strong> Some may say that using DreamWeaver alienates me from the code. While that is true, my response to them would be that I would rather be focusing on the content which I am producing, or planning to produce. No one is even fooling themselves in saying that modern browsers on modern devices can't handle marginally-inefficient XHTML markup generated by the program. </p>

<p>But others may say that <em>&quot;it limits further development and locks down the user to only use the visual editor, because the code is so messy.&quot;</em> The code, looking at it now, isn't very messy at all. My laptop screen is quite small, which forces the lines to be wrapped, but the code is otherwise perfectly fine. I am using a very simple setup, but anyone with knowledge of how HTML syntax works can easily go in and change attributes and tags.</p>
