    	<h1>How I Manage My Site</h1>
    	<p>Though there is probably no one that cares, I thought that I would share my method of managing my site while using an external editor if anyone else is having trouble.</p>
    	<hr>
    	<p>I am currently using the Sublime Text Editor for my HTML and CSS documents. It has opens sidebar with the directory tree when you click File>Open Folder, and it's quite useful if you want to edit numerous HTML files at once. Plus, it's got tabs. In my opinion, Sublime's layout/colors and independant zoom capability is superior to the NeoCities code editor.</p>
    	<h3>How I Sync Local and Server</h3>
    	<p>You might be thinking: <i>if you're editing offline in Sublime, won't it be tedious to keep your files in sync with Neocities?</i> While this is true to an extent, you can make it much easier in many ways, of which can be the following:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Go to Dashboard, find the bottom links and click "Download Entire Site."</li>
    		<li>Open your editor (in my case Sublime) and set the root directory of it's file browser, if supported, to the downloaded site folder. This makes it easy to click and edit HTML files. Obviously, unzip the folder first, too.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Since the Neocities Dashboard allows multiple file uploads, you can select a whole bunch of locally edited (i.e., out of sync) HTML pages/files and upload them all at once, which I think is very useful. Files with the same names are automatically replaced/overwritten. Unfortunately, Neocities doesn't allow drag-and-drop uploads of entire folders/directories, but this should not be much of a problem due to the above feature.</p>
