    <p>I only post on condition that the argument presented by the article, if there is one, is backed by reasoning that makes sense and is strong. It does not necessarily mean that I support the argument or have a strong advocation for it; even if I do, I post not as a means of "propaganda" or to push an agenda but as a means of sharing knowledge that I deem useful for onlookers.</p>
