    <h1>"The Emperor Has No Clothes!"</h1>
    <p>The origin and an explanation of the phrase, as well as the summarized story itself.</p>
    <p>Written 1/13/19. Minor changes, 2/3/19.</p>

    <h3>Phrase Origin</h3>
    <p>The phrase originates from a children’s story titled <i>The Emperor’s New Clothes</i> by <i>Hans Christian Andersen.</i></p>
    
      <p>(Story plot adapted from <a href="http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheEmperorsNewClothes_e.html">[here]</a>)</p>
    
    <p>The short story follows an emperor who is very fond of his clothing. He’d spend all of his money on new clothing, wore something new at every hour, and cared about nothing but showing off his new clothes.</p>
    <p>In the great city where he lived, which was always bustling with newcomers, there were two swindlers who purported to be special, highly-skilled weavers. These “weavers” had said that they could weave clothing of fabric that became invisible to those who were unfit for their position or just “usually stupid.”</p>
    <p>The emperor thought that he could use such clothing to discover which men in his empire were unfit for their posts, and tell wise from fool. He paid the swindlers a huge sum to start their work on clothes for him at once.</p>
    <p>To check on the “weavers’” progress, the emperor had sent his honest old minister to them. To his internal surprise, the minister could not, in fact, see any of the clothes. But he didn’t say so. The swindlers asked him to tell them what he thought. Afraid to let them know that he couldn’t see anything, he told them that their work was “beautiful, and enchanting.” </p>
    <p>The emperor sent another highly ranking official to check on the swindlers’ progress. This official could not see anything but, again, did not want to let anyone know that he was possibly unfit for his position. The swindlers acted as though there were intricate patterns on the imaginary cloth, pretending to weave and weave, constantly asking for his opinion. For fear of letting them know he was unfit or too stupid for his position, he as well praised the work which he could not see.</p>
    <p>Soon, all of town was speaking of this magnificent cloth. Finally, the emperor brought himself and two closest men with him to see the weavers. The men, duped like the ones before, praised and praised the invisible work. The emperor could not see the cloth and was, internally, astounded. Afraid of letting be known his unfitted-ness or stupidity, he as well highly praised its visual and attested the work's beauty. </p>
    <p>Pretending to cut and assemble the fabrics, the swindlers then moved their hands around as if fitting it on to the emperor, now undressed of his original attire. The swindlers also went on and on about the intricacies and astounding design; the noblemen of the emperor agreed in unison, though there was absolutely nothing to see.</p>
    <p>On the way to his canopy, the noblemen acted as if they were picking up his mantle, not dare admitting they had nothing to hold.</p>
    <p>With the emperor on the canopy having on his magnificent, invisible clothing, the crowds of townspeople cheered and cheered and admired his attire.</p>
    <p><b>“But he hasn’t got anything on!”</b> A little child spoke.</p>
    <p>Soon everyone spoke out that the emperor, in fact, was wearing absolutely nothing. Except his underwear.</p>
    
      <h3>What It Means, Why It's Used</h3>
    
    <p>The special, imaginary fabric was said to be invisible to idiots. The emperor’s men and the emperor himself, when they <i>definitely</i> hadn’t seen it, pretended as though they could see it. Why? They were afraid they’d be called dumb or unfit based on the special fabric’s criteria.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the same thing happens in the real world. Not with weavers and imaginary clothes, but with ideas and knowledge. Let’s say there is a bogus idea in an imaginary society that goes as follows: when someone is writing on paper, it is the instrument and not the hand moving allowing the writing to happen. Let us also say that scientists of this society, celebrities of this society and politicians of this society attest this as completely and undeniably true, publishing hundreds of long, boring papers and articles giving what are in actuality bogus proof and information. Perhaps the idea is considered common knowledge, with children being taught it as they grow up, schools remaining indifferent. </p>
    <p>Because of these high-ranking people attesting the idea’s truth, because of these hundreds of publications attesting its truth the average person will, with a high likeliness, reflexively believe it to be true just because it appears to be the norm. Even if he didn’t understand the idea completely or even if he didn’t believe it and had major doubts, he probably wouldn’t vocalize his thoughts in fear of being ridiculed.</p>
    <p>Thus, when someone remarks a situation with “the emperor’s got no clothes,” it can be seen as, in essence, saying “hey, you’ve all been duped: the [situation, idea, argument, whatever] is actually like this…” </p>
    <p>It can also appear as someone afraid to admit their misunderstanding or lack of understanding about a subject in fear of looking unknowledgable or stupid, in which they might then just hide the fact or pretend to be understanding. In this instance the individual is taking part in the <i>crowd's</i> role from the story. Of course, the situation also depends: it can technically be either beneficial or harmful to do this. Either way, it is labelled and known as an act of pretentiousness regarding one's knowledge and, obviously, is not really a sign of one's credibility because it shows that there is an emphasis of outward reputation over true character or knowhow.</p>
