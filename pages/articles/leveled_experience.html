    <h1>A Leveled Experience</h1>
    <p>Drafted Nov. 18th; Revised Nov. 27th; Finalized Dec. 23rd.</p>
    <p>A short essay on education; a call to encourage catering more to the student and to lessen intellectual uniformity throughout schooling.</p>
    <p><i>(Well, it's more about writing and authorship, but generalizes as the writing continues.)</i></p>
    <hr>
    
    <p>In every year of school that I had attended, there was always a class called “ELA,” or simply “English” in our schedules. In this class, students learn the basics of English grammar, writing, and perhaps read a few classic stories and create a few colorful projects. All, or most, of the essentials required for one to be well-educated and well-off, to an extent, in the “real world.” Most of the work and material, of course, is improving on one's reading and writing skills.</p>
    <p>Except, I do not think we write enough to make any major impact on our skill. We are given assignments that at first seem to require true writing ability but end up being given with a concise template or incredibly fine rubric from the start, both of which at times even lay out exactly what the student should do to get a high grade. Of course, the student needs a rubric–or even a template–as guidance; but not to the extent that it disturbs the writing process or nullifies it. Not yet have I seen any assignment in which we write a multi-page story, analysis or argument that is, even be it to a margin, open-ended at its core and devoid of the latter disturbances. An assignment in which the student has the chance to truly attempt his or her best at writing. No template that nullifies or makes too easy the planning and most certainly no detailed rubric that makes the assignment into a mere “meeting of the criterion,” but an actual work that requires genuine creativity and effort. Years ago,while I was in fourth grade, my teacher assigned to us a story project in which we had the opportunity to fabricate a character with traits that we desired it to have, a plot that could go anywhere–it was completely open-ended (but only within the constraints of traditional story-writing.) The rubric, likewise, was not defeating the purpose of the assignment but simply provided generic, leveled criteria. The template was, as well, not defeating the purpose of the assignment by giving the perfect structure of an ideal story, but gave a much more generic structure that could even be–surprise!–changed and altered by the student the way he or she wanted as long as it still made sense. If they used it, of course.</p>
    <p>But one might interrupt me by arguing that those defeating rubrics or templates may, in fact, help the students who do not want to complete the assignment (or have no passion for writing) to more easily complete it and pass, thus making it fair for both the passionate and the unwilling. But they don't. The unwilling students might be put out of the burden of a seemingly massive effort by essentially being given a grand-plan for their assignment, but it does not actually help them, much less make them any better at writing or planning. In the context of younger students, it both damages their ability to plan their work and write their ideas down for others to read; it merely makes them feel better at that moment, makes them feel better that little effort is required, and further allows the cultivation of laziness and makes it commonplace in their lives. This may encourage the silly delusion, even if it isn't articulated, that things in life are planned out for you by others. They aren't, and we should not be giving our younger writers such easy and low-level work as copying a template or striving to meet nothing but a given, detailed criteria. It does not encourage creativity, it does not encourage genuine authorship.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, there is an urgent need to have leveled English classes for much younger students than the ones we give to now. A two-level writing curriculum for certain fourth-graders, for example. Younger students usually have brighter, more creative and more adept minds. If we can allow more of those younger students, those bright children, who want to pursue writing to pursue it, we might just end up with a whole lot more authors, a whole lot more scholars, and a whole lot more novelists. Perhaps.</p>
    <p>Resources and space, of course, will be only a few of the several limiting factors that come forth with those ideals. However, those ideals are what I think should be propagated, at least attempted. Those ideals are what I believe to run contrary, to attack the potentially dangerous factor of standardization in schools. Dangerous to what? To the growth and expansion of students' minds. Younger students will always work at wildly different paces and have wildly varying ideas. To encourage the uniformity of those naturally varying aspects—to encourage the uniformity of ideas, pace and creativity—within such a vibrant group will, I think, severely damage the great potential for the excelling to excel further, the creative to continue thinking out of the box, and the lagging to catch up at an optimal pace.</p>
    <p>While detrimental in some aspects, standardization is actually still a necessity. For a group of twenty or so little kids to be directed or guided (in other words, be taught anything meaningful) while avoiding chaos, some standardization, some uniformity, is required. You can't have some students working on one part of something and the others on another all while the instructor is trying to get a point across expecting them to all be on one section—it just wouldn't work. At least not with the limited amount of teachers assigned to the seemingly limitless amount of children. This, and all of the above, I understand. We cannot go without some uniformity if we want to avoid crashing into chaos. But we also cannot go with too much of it, lest we mitigate much of the intellectual growth that the young students can so easily and so quickly achieve when put to their own pace. Whether that pace is standardized to be slower than normal or faster than normal, it stands true that we cannot apply or encourage it to an extent that is even a bit too much.</p>
    <p><i>"If you want the classes to be catered to the students so much, why can't we just encourage them to pursue whatever they wish in their own time where they run free, rather than putting the burden on us school teachers and officials?"</i> I've already mentioned the burden of resources, and I understand that issue. This, however, is interesting. The drive to instead encourage the students to pursue all of this in their own time rather than putting the effort on our public schools. Why are we to assume, if we are trying to propagate this to those younger students, those younger children, that they know exactly what they are pursuing? If they do, then why are we to assume they know how they are going to pursue it? Should we not, instead, guide them and allow them to properly cultivate, to use, the creative energies and sharp minds they have within them instead of leaving them to their own? Might they head in the wrong direction and end up making no use of, or wasting, the latter powers? And this in part applies to the older students as well–teenagers, while older than third or fourth graders, still might not know what they want to achieve in life, what talents they have, what skill or profession they want to pursue. We should attempt to guide them in figuring all of that out, to give them the mental tools and guidance with which they will live out in, if you will, the “real world.” Isn't that what our education is really for?</p>
    <p>Another issue arises with such an argument: it does not consider the natural tendencies that burden youngsters in general. Some young adults included. They, or we, are immature and want to do more things the easy way. The desire is to lie in our couches, not do homework, play outside and sleep in every morning. Why? The reason, I suggest, is because of how tiring and requiring school can sometimes be–or can always be–for any child. We start our school legacy at the ripe age of five and usually are required to be at school from an early hour in the morning. An hour that most, even at five, do not even want to be awake. At that early hour, when most are groggy and half-asleep, we are plunged into a social environment that can be very taxing for those who a more introverted. We dive in to a bustling building with our peers, to then be asked to sit in rooms and listen to a teacher, think, participate and solve a whole lot of problems. It is an environment that asks much from us. When we're dismissed, most of us are tired, even exhausted, from the day. Seeking refuge from this taxing environment, we go home and sit for a while and relax. Each day follows this structure–we wake up tired, go to school, come back exhausted and finally sit back and take a break at our house. Some even sleep. Others who don't like sitting around in a building go out with friends or pursue sports. I suggest, then, that school is correlated, thought of, as a place of hard working and hard thinking. Our home, or being out of school, is likewise thought of as a place of relaxation and laziness, or as a place of fun and no rules with no requirement of the individual to think hard. With so many correlations and seemingly inevitable bad habits emerging from them, how can we expect even our older students–adolescents or teenagers–to “pursue whatever they wish” in their own time? Our “own time,” as it turns out, is not actually just a time of running free. We've got our habits and obligations to tend to.</p>
    <p>The solution, then, is to cater the curriculum more to the individual students–lessen the intellectual uniformity–while at the same time following a grander curriculum to mitigate chaos. Give them a leveled experience–it's the best experience they'll ever get.</p>
