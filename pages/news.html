	<p>Welcome to the Elaboraet Changelog.</p>

	<hr>
	
	<p><strong>Mar. 21st, 2019: </strong>After some dormancy and several weeks of messing with a personal Apache server (painstakingly modifying config files wihtout knowing how they worked, having to figure out how domains worked, obtaining an SSL certificate, experimenting with and finally scrapping WordPress once again, et al) I figured that I may as well settle for a third-party host provider once again. The power was in my hands with my own server (I could use up as much storage as I could afford to buy), but there were several downsides or, if you will, "gotchas." The bigger of them being, of course, was that <i>I had to keep my computer running</i>, meaning I couldn't turn it off in case I actually had regular visitors. The longest uptime of the short-lasted server was on its first revision: five days and twelve hours. - While third party hosting, especially free, is a bit limited (1 GB projected storage quota), it is certainly much faster and reliable. I feel that it holds greater potential for wherever I wish to take the site regarding its ambitions and goals, minus the energy costs and DDoS vulnerabilities. Elaboraet is back in action, folks.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Feb. 24th, 2019: </strong>Elaboraet has moved from Neocities. Thank you, Neocities for the excellent service!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Feb. 19th, 2019: </strong>Internet addiction occurs not only because of things like addictive user interfaces and its instant-gratification, but also largely because <i>we use it to avoid negativity.</i> We learn to instinctually use it to distract ourselves from our negative thoughts and emotions.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Feb. 15th, 2019: </strong>Article AA6 is now due for revision. I took time to read through it twice and, unsurprisingly, it had several mistakes. Notwithstanding the mechanical flow of the writing, that being one of them, I found that some of the sources aren't even working. Great credibility right there.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Feb. 3rd, 2019: </strong>Looks like I don't need a 'last updated' for any PDF articles I create. The date is always set to the time of export; thus, exporting an updated the document automatically declares a new date. I might need to figure out a 'revision history' type thing, soon, though.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Feb. 2nd, 2019: </strong>The first, finished draft of Article AA6 has been published. Linked to a PDF because sifting through the exported HTML each time is absolute mayhem.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Jan. 29th, 2019: </strong>A small draft of Article AA6 has been posted. Like the formatting? It was exported to HTML using <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/lyx.html">LyX</a>, a visual <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/about/">LaTeX</a> editor. (If you want to write good-looking, professional-esque papers, I <i>highly suggest</i> you learn how to use LaTeX. It's an excellent typesetting language that is relatively easy to pick up and is able to serve as an incredibly useful tool for writing.)</p>
	
	<p><strong>Jan. 13th, 2019: </strong>Article AA5 on The Emperor's New Clothes has been posted.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Jan. 10th, 2019: </strong>I'm not one who is terribly keen on writing tutorials, so I decided to work seriously on an informational article. On what? <b>JavaScript.</b> ~ An informational article on JavaScript (on mainly history, practicality/uses and trivia) will arrive by the end of January. </p>
	
	<p><strong>Jan. 9th, 2019: </strong>In pursuit to make this site more friendly to use and to keep true to the rule of spreading knowledge with little obstacle, anyone may now reference any Original Article from the sections. Although a link back to ELRT would be appreciated, I feel that it is the best course of action.</p>
	
	<p><strong><i>Dec. 31st, 2018: </i></strong>Elaboraet has made it to 2019. Thank you for following Elaboraet.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Dec. 23nd, 2018: </strong>A small <a href="https://elaboraet.pcroit.org/pages/articles/conservatism_review.html">article</a> (wonder if one could even call it that) or review has been posted of a book entitled <i>Conservatism</i> by Roger Scruton.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Dec. 12th, 2018: </strong>The frontpage buttons and my own buttons have been converged into one singular page entitled "Buttons and Links." â€” In other news, an article may perhaps arrive soon if I am able to push edits in time.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Dec. 4th, 2018: </strong>Rant: I find it interesting how even the cheap/mainstream computer keyboards from ~1970 -> ~1999 were built with what seems like exceptional switch and build quality today. Nowadays, if you want a decent office keyboard, you'd most likely only find cheap OEM membrane keyboards that were probably manufactured for less than a dollar in place of a Model M or Dell AT101. Without making a big investment or vouching for a vintage keyboard, one cannot easily find a decent mechanical board that isn't suited with the flashiest colors and ugliest postmodern design targetting "gamers" for ridiculous prices. || Should I add a "Rants" section to ELRT?</p>
	
	<p><strong>Nov. 28th, 2018: </strong>Added some more seamless pattern backgrounds to a few pages that lacked them.</p>

	<p><strong>Nov. 25th, 2018: </strong>The entire site has been aesthetically reworked and layout concept changed. Internal HTML files have been cleaned up, again, from unecessary whitespaces, junk/useless/fluff code, and generally undesireable premises. Boredom can really push one to be creative, huh?</p>

	<p><strong>Nov. 22nd, 2018: </strong>Article AA3 has been extended and revised. Minor revision to article AA1.</p>

	<p><strong>Nov. 4th, 2018: </strong>After quite a long time, an article on topic of <I>Context Collapse</i> in society will be posted today, if not tomorrow. <b>Edit: </b> Article <a href="https://elaboraet.pcroit.org/pages/articles/Context_Collapse.html">AA3</a> has been posted. Hmm, how long has it been? 3 months? Anyway, here it is. My intentions are, now, to release articles more often; I am open to any suggestions, just email me using the About page EMAIL button.</p>

	<p><strong>Oct. 31st, 2018: </strong>About 2 months ago, I conceptualized using Zim Wiki to publish articles instead of hand-writing them in HTML. I, at the time, did not see it worthwhile: I would need to alter the resulting output from exporting the local wiki. Speaking of exporting, using this method I will probably have to export the entire local wiki and upload the differing page or two (possibly edit the ToC page and surrounding pages as well for optimal navigation) to NeoCities, for it to then be on Elaboraet. However, despite these setbacks, I may use a method like this to write and publish articles from now on in order to make the process much simpler.</p>
        
	<p><strong>Oct. 25th, 2018: </strong>Articles will now have 3-character labels for easy reference. As a starter, <a href="https://elaboraet.pcroit.org/pages/articles/bloatedsites.html">Article AA2</a> 
        has been slightly revised (and cleaned up of images at the moment) to reflect on newly discovered information.</p>
        
	<p><strong>Oct. 22nd, 2018: </strong> I've added a simple "Quote of the Week" box to the main page. This used to be a place for poems, but I couldn't find very many; finally decided to put interesting or powerful quotes instead, coming from various known intellectuals and authors.</p>
        
	<p><strong>Oct. 8th, 2018:</strong> To whom it may concern: I have used at least a half-dozen excuses for being late on articles, and I'm aware of it. Seeing that a 'schedule' or 'routine' (whatever those are) never works--never really had, anyway--I'll post when I feel that the content is significant enough to be posted. If there's a gap of over 10 months between one article and the last, then chances are that either I have abandoned Elaboraet (which I am determined not to do), or that I am away, without a viable device to edit my website, or seriously not feeling like it. In any case, this time I won't provide any specific month or date for the next article; the next article will come - wait for it... Soon!</p>

	<p><strong>Sept. 21st, 2018:</strong> A laptop that I had ordered has finally arrived last Tuesday (any ThinkPad T510 fans out here?). My friends tell me this is a bad idea, but with a keyboard as nice as this, I beg to differ. -- A new article has been linked to <a href="linkedarticles.html">Recommended Articles.</a> Internal structure changed again; there is no longer a 'checkpoint' in which the root index page acted as a redirect to a homepage. Home.html is now Index.html--some obscure 'go home' links might be broken for a bit. Added some new site banners to the home page.</p>

	<p><strong>Sept. 10th, 2018:</strong> Took a break; expect minor improvements throughout the course of September, and expect a new article by early October. I am currently busy. However, major changes will no longer be as frequent as previous weeks because I believe that the grand scheme of Elaboraet has been successfully laid-out. All individual article pages will support dynamic width for easy mobile viewing, but, as a consequence, cannot contain the CSS navbar.</p>

	<p><strong>Sept. 3rd, 2018:</strong> A fixed sidebar has been added to every page. All HTML code has been extensively cleaned up (hey, I was bored) and hyperlinks now resolve correctly if one were to keep an offline version of the site. A new table-of-contents page has been added and will, if I am able/willing to, be kept up-to-date with any new page additions. I am now using Sublime Text to edit/compose Elaboraet pages. If you'd like to see how I manage my site and its files in case you are looking for a more efficient method for your own site, <a href="articles/management.html">click here.</a> However, I am also instead considering using a personal wiki like <a href="http://www.zim-wiki.org">ZimWiki</a> to easily link and upload large hierarchies of pre-stylized 'articles' or journal/blog-like writings on various subjects and topics. One issue that arises with this thought is how I would create a consistent theme across this format and the originally posted Elaboraet articles. Expect changes sooner or later. <b>Edit:</b> Mobiles no longer supported. Desktop version now appears on mobile browsers.</p> 

	<p><strong>Sept. 2nd, 2018:</strong> Minor visual changes. Entire internal structure of the site has been changed. Index.html, upon visit, instantly redirects to pages/home.html as part of the restructure.</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 31st, 2018:</strong> <s>Every page (except pages deliberately made to look legacy) now has a fancy CSS vertical navigation column. Hopefully this makes the site easier to use instead of clicking on an assortment of links at the top of every page. Articles will retain the previous nav style.</s> Changes have been rolled back--I broke a bunch of stuff trying to make it "modern."</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 30th, 2018:</strong> I have fixed several instances of incorrect 'tone' in the site's language on various pages (still working on it). Most pages no longer read like they were written by an edgy teenager.</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 29th, 2018:</strong> A new article has been written and posted in the Original Articles catalog. Any mistakes may be fixed momentarily. A new 'site buttons' page has been added if anyone wants an Elaboraet button--or a few. New personal/experimental homepage coming soon.</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 28th, 2018:</strong> A few articles have been linked to <i>Recommended Readings</i>, and one article is currently being written. More internal enhancements and optimization have been committed. Bad grammar and a few typos have also been fixed. Navigation hyperlinks are now placed at the tops of pages instead of the very bottom; no need to scroll for nav links anymore.</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 27th, 2018:</strong> The site has been hugely improved and minimal styling has been added; mobile devices are also now supported. The Article Catalog pages have been extensively upgraded: Now, articles that I have written and articles that I linked (that I haven't written but want others to read) have been separated into the categories, "Original Articles," and "Recommended Readings." Moreover, core site code has been cleaned up, but I don't think this is relevant for anyone but me, as no visual changes resulted from this.</p>

	<p><strong>Aug. 26th, 2018:</strong> Site is born. Looks like a barebones site from 1992.</p>
