	<h1>About Elaboraet</h1>
	<p>Elaboraet is a site dedicated to the authoring and collection of articles.</p>
	<hr>
	<div style="background-color:palegoldenrod; padding:5px">
		<h3>The Goal of Elaboraet</h3>
		<p>As ambitious as it sounds, I plan to make Elaboraet a more-or-less extensive, original virtual catalog of articles both written by me and by others. The articles by me are currently listed under the Original Articles category, and the articles that I have linked—written by others—are under the Recommended Readings category.</p>
		<a href="articles/elaboraet-history.html"> A History of Elaboraet</a> - Wondering why this site is called 'Elaboraet'?<br>

		<h3>Writing Quality or "Prose Style"</h3>
		<p>I'm a learning writer! My current goal is to achieve a style in which I efficiently convey my meaning without 'fluff' or extraneous words. If you'd like to provide suggestions or critique on any of my writing, feel free to post a message or email me.</p>
		<p><i>Notice: </i>Being a hobby site, the information presented by me, although I will try to be accurate at all times, may not be wholly standard or even correct; I'm only one person, am not a professional, and do not earn any money for doing this. Likewise, this being a hobby, I probably won't build the site as if I depend on it—rather, I'll do it for fun and writing potentially useful content for passersby to read and spend time on.</p>
		<h3>Think this site looks ugly?</h3>
		<p>This website marks my first time attempting a hand-written website, so expect, to an extent, that Elaboraet will look like a website from the early '00s for a while; however, I don't plan on using templates, pre-written frameworks (am I using that term correctly?) or themes or whatnot. For more advanced stuff, I am considering on implementing (and learning) JavaScript, though this may be in the distant future. </p>
		<p>This entire site is about <i>2.6 MB</i> on the NeoCities host. However, that doesn't necessarily mean your browser downloads 2.6 MB each time you visit. Using a site measuring tool, Elaboraet on NeoCities only stores about <i>68.0 KB</i> (may vary slightly from browser to browser) on first visit to the homepage, indicating that only 68 kilobytes are being requested on first visit to the homepage.</p>
		<h3>Contact Me</h3>
		<p>I have my email embedded into the "E-MAIL" button below if you want to contact me. I used to be active on Discord, but have since avoided it. <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html">Here's why.</a> </p>

		<p>I don't use social media.</p>
