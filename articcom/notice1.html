    <h1>Important to Remember</h1>
  	<p>The author makes no attempt to be an ultimate, absolutely reliable source of information or knowledge. The author will not be held liable for how the reader decides to use his work.</p>
    <p>In other words, remember: <b>Use common sense. I am not an encyclopedia.</b> It would be a mistake to cite me as a source in a formal essay you are writing.</p>
    <p>Do you have comments, critiques, or do you hate me for writing something? Send me an email using the 'Mail a Comment' button on the sidebar, visible on each A&C page. I will try to respond to your comment and consider any suggestions you make, if I am able to do so.</p>
