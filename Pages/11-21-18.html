			<h1>Context Collapse <a name='Pages:11-21-18'></a></h1>

			<p>
We naturally act differently according to the context or situation at hand. For example: you would use a different range of vocabulary, behavior and expressions around your close/best friends compared to your parents, someone you fancy compared to one whom is of disinterest to you, to your professor or teacher compared to your best friends or sibling/s, and so on. We share different parts and information about ourselves and talk about different ranges of topics with different people; this is no surprise—we all act differently near people (or groups of people) with whom we have different relations. These different groups of people can then be referred to as our "audiences."
</p>

<p>
But this is not what people call being two-faced. Two-faced, to put it in my own words, would be to say true one thing to one 'audience' and then say true different or contradicting information to another audience. In other words, hypocrisy. The official definition of being two-faced is to be “insincere and deceitful.,” one of its many synonyms being the word 'hypocritical.'
</p>

<p>
When our audiences converge, the different behaviors and topics that we used to 'reserve' for certain people/groups or for certain contexts and situations collapse into one uncomfortable level. To illustrate, if we were to bring any average individual and put them with their closest friends, their parents, and their teachers or professors all in one small room, the different behaviors or topics one would have used for appropriate situations or audiences collapse—hence the phrase 'context collapse.' If this individual was one who had major differences between different audiences, they may been mentally stumped, have increased self-consciousness or been socially anxious: How do I do X that I do with my friends all the time next to my parents, next to my professors? How do I talk about X or talk in an XYZ way with my parents while my friends are around, or vice versa? The magnitude or size of this effect and its 'symptons' can differ amongst different individuals; the problem may be very small if they do not differ in major ways with their personality or what things they share near different audiences. These differences, again, are not to the extent where they could be described as hypocrisy or 'two-facedness:' it would be impossible to act the exact same way, talk the same way, or share the same information about yourself in any different situation or any different audience. It is natural, inevitable, to be different to some people than others—more generally, it is inevitable to act different in different situations. However, it is where these differences overlap or contradict where it is then defined as hypocrisy or 'two-facedness.' In any case, the way we present ourselves varies—sometimes heavily—based on the audience at hand.
</p>

<p>
"When would such a convergence of audiences happen in real life?" One may ask. An easy answer to this question would be social media. At around the time Facebook became public, many people were concerned (almost furious) with its design encouraging users to remain less "private," such as tempting users to post more, personal pictures, and encouraging, sometimes enforcing the use of real names or usual nicknames. The bigger problem, here, arose with Facebook's design forcing its users to share to multiple audiences at once. Think again of the illustration above: Would you be comfortable sharing the usual dirty joke with your close friends and your parents at the same time? In Facebook, all of one's audiences—via their Friends list—are converged into one, causing anxiety or confusion as to what one could share, if at all. To give another example, what would you like to share on Instagram if there existed all of your friends, closest and furthest, as your one audience? What about YouTube? Do we have to think long and hard to consider what would be appropriate to share to all of them at once and create a new, unified “face” accomodating every audience that has been converged? Maybe this is why kids remain on different platforms instead of, for example, Facebook in order to avoid their parents (who may not have ventured these exotic, new platforms) from seeing what they share with their friends—showing that they have a different “face” while with a given group of friends in contrast to being with their parents. This is normal. Later, Facebook attempted to encourage users to share more (to collect more userdata; but that is a different matter) via the addition of allowing users to categorize their friends and share to each category or group separately. Despite this, users did not follow through and seemed to refrain. Comment visibility remained global.
</p>

<p>
We manage our self-presentations or "faces" with people and navigate through them all the time as the context changes. The phrase context collapse describes the process of the levels of audiences collapsing for a given individual and no longer being distinct. After a contextual collapse, we can no longer manage our "faces" well, if at all, as whatever "face" we give will be presented to everyone and anyone at the same time. We have to fabricate a new, “global” face, one that cateres to every single audience. One may interject at that point and say, "Why don't we just control our 'friends' lists and 'followers' so that we can comfortably retain the levels of context within social media?" This may be a viable solution, but it is too good to be true and I imagine that its attempts would be futile. As far as my knowledge of mainstream social media goes, how would one "control" their followers, i.e., who follows them? On Instagram there exists a "private profile" mode, in which others can "ask" to follow and gain access to profile pictures—the owner being of decision whether to accept these requests or not. But, in this case, anxiety may arise: Perhaps my profile is tailored to my best, closest friends whom I joke around with. What if a girl I fancy asks to follow me? What then? Do I swap-out all of my posts in a jiffy and pretend I was a philosophical profile all along, not the one posting potentially offensive Spongebob memes every weekend or, more generally, content that contradicts the personality I have presented to this person I fancy? What if my parent or another relative requests a follow, and I am in the same situation? Do I ask them to follow my "formal and polite" profile instead, possibly generating suspicion as to what I am doing with the profile at hand? Must we take measures into our own hands and try our best to keep these "worlds" separate? The same may most likely apply to Facebook but, as I have not used Facebook in several years, am not aware of any new profile features that may have been introduced since then.
</p>

<p>
What further follows this is that while this is a prevalent trend, almost no one acknowledges it, beyond some academics and anthropologists. Perhaps users know of this but cannot put a name on it; far too often I see people on a platform like Facebook with relatives in their Friends list from across the globe. These such people (as a helpful example, no discrimination is intended) will remain cautious as to what they share on Facebook, or whatever platform they're on with a similar situation. Let us say that they have close friends in their Friends or followers list as well, which I would imagine to be the most common case. At this point, the context in which they form their "face" or present themselves is unified and homogenized; they have a different personality around their friends than around their relatives, and can no longer post X for friends and Y for relatives on his/her profile, but XY with both friends and relatives on his/her profile.
</p>

<p>
Regarding social media, there have been attempts, of course, to solve contextual collapse. A prominent example of such an attempt is Facebook’s grouped-friend feature, allowing one to share content to group X, but not YZ, or XY and not Z (and vice versa). This does not entirely solve the problem, however. Statistics of users actually using this feature on Facebook drop low; many do not participate in this feature and perhaps may avoid sharing entirely, potentially contributing to the doom of Facebook’s business model. Kids stick to their platforms and perhaps parents, elderly and other relatives stick to others. Take, for example, the Snapchat/Instagram to Facebook divide. Kids seem to be using Instagram and Snapchat, while parents may use Facebook—the supposed ‘old people’ platform. This stereotype is most likely believed solely due to the situation of most kids and teens staying away from it—their parents happened to have accounts there, and they certainly do not want them seeing questionable or potentially rebellious content, so they hop on over to Instagram, Snapchat, you name it. As long as guardians are on one platform, and if the alternatives are easy to use, look appealing and other friends are willing to join, the divide will occur. Only on chance, obviously, that social media is such an appealing thing to be a part of, in their minds, in the first place. I must mention that contextual collapse is limited not only to the sphere of social media (though it is the most prominent and easy example of context collapse), but also in other modern media.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion that many anthropologists and researchers have come to is that our modern media culture inevitably gives rise to such a problem as contextual collapse in many parts of our lives. Take television, for example. Literal context as well as social context have been stricken out of order due to the advent of televised media (a good author, one of my favorite authors, to read on this issue is Neil Postman—most notably one of his books entitled Amusing Ourselves to Death). Smartphones and computers—and I am not advocating the practice of being a luddite—only compound such a problem, adding entire new levels and concerns to be observed.
