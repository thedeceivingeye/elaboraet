			<h1>All Websites Look the Same <a name='Pages:08-28-18'></a></h1>

			<p>
If you were to visit a modern website known for it’s “modernity,” “style,” and “innovation,” you’ll find that most of them look more or less the exact same. When the internet was in a relative infancy, everyone--almost always--had to design their sites from scratch. The result of this was a huge level of diversity, and variety; sites back then were actually quite interesting. Nowadays, all we see are big flat color blocks, a big picture of something like a coffee cup or anything that has a tendency to be called ‘hip,’ a bold call-to-action, more color blocks, some depth parallax here, some minimal animations there. Oh, and don’t forget a picture of some happy foreigner if you’re a business that has anything to do with humanitarian needs. It’s all the same.
</p>

<p>
What happened here, I believe, was the use of easy-to-implement, pre-built templates or frameworks in which even amateur web designers/developers could get a good grasp of and get going fast. While this was all cool and dandy, creativity and the opportunity for it fell low. One example of this is Bootstrap, responsible for over 6 million sites that look and feel, in my opinion, the exact same. They all use some sort of base grid layout, some variation of flat, material or fluent design, some form of parallax, and, again, giant pictures that probably push the site size well over 2-4 megabytes per page.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that the average size of a website as of 2017 was 3 MB. A website like CNN.com, using tools.pingdom.com, took 6.34 seconds to load fully, was 3.1 MB in size, made 338 total requests, and received a D performance grade. This was tested from their New York server. However, GTmetrix website performance testing resources, server located in Vancouver, Canada, reported that the site was 5.34 MB in total size, made 554 requests, and received a PageSpeed score of 26% (F) and a YSlow score of 50% (D). Oh, and the total load time was 13.4 seconds. For a comparison, NeoCities.org took 1.4 seconds to load using GTmetrix and 1.93 seconds to load using Pingdom using NY and Canada respectively.
</p>

Adobe Flash, in its prime, enabled developers to create sites that were incredibly exotic, dynamic, were very interesting and overall appealing and fun to use or navigate. Now, this is not to say that every single site made with flash was a beautiful, unique work of art, and also not to say that sites made with something like Bootstrap are all mundane, redundant and boring, but what I am speaking of here is a general, noticeable, predominant pattern. Flash, unfortunately, nearly died and was almost wiped out due to lack of widespread mobile support. We have become a media culture that prioritizes mobile devices as #1.
</p>

<p>
One great example of the mundane nature the modern web has adopted is this site: <a href="http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/" title="http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/" class="http">http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/</a>. Now, I’ll be honest, many of the business-startup websites I see look exactly like this. There is a full-width header with a picture behind it, a typographic style equipped with a thin, non-serif font, etc. Don’t forget the ‘hip’ pictures. Never forget them.
</p>

<a href="http://unmatchedstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/every-bootstrap-site-ever.jpg" title="http://unmatchedstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/every-bootstrap-site-ever.jpg" class="http">http://unmatchedstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/every-bootstrap-site-ever.jpg</a>
</p>

<p>
Though possibly subjective, one real example is a site called Internet.org. This site takes what looks like a two-column boxed grid touched up with border-less separations and “artsy” pictures of foreigners smiling and blows it up to your screen size. While good and adaptive for mobiles, this looks a bit oversized on a decently sized monitor.
</p>

<p>
Sites that I'd consider exceptional—that being, have a visible emphasis on content over design; or that the design is not bloated, slow or deliberately obstructive—are CNN's 'lite' variant or NPR's 'lite' variant. These seem to be the official HTML-only versions of the popular CNN and NPR news websites, whose parent sites (cnn.com and npr.com) are usually noted to be unreasonably heavy or even slow on weaker devices. Of course, sites like these are to many very boring, and the design may chase away visitors. It would the pursuit of internet companies, then, to make their websites adept at grabbing one's attention and enticing or very delightful to use; sites like these usually have myriad designers and researchers behind their planning to grab one's attention and encourage users to stay on the sight for longer.
