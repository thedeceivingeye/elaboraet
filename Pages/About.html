	<h1>About Elaboraet</h1>
	<p>Elaboraet is a site dedicated to the authoring and collection of articles.</p>
	<hr>

		<h3>The Goal of Elaboraet</h3>
		<p>As ambitious as it sounds, I plan to make Elaboraet a more-or-less extensive, original virtual catalog of articles both written by me and by others. The articles by me are currently listed under the Original Articles category, and the articles that I have linked—written by others—are under the Recommended Readings category.</p>
		<a href="articles/elaboraet-history.html"> A History of Elaboraet</a> - Wondering why this site is called 'Elaboraet'?<br>

		<h3>Writing Quality or "Prose Style"</h3>
		<p>I'm a learning writer! My current goal is to achieve a style in which I efficiently convey my meaning without 'fluff' or extraneous words. If you'd like to provide suggestions or critique on any of my writing, feel free to post a message or email me.</p>
		<p><i>Notice: </i>Being a hobby site, the information presented by me, although I will try to be accurate at all times, may not be wholly standard or even correct; I'm only one person, am not a professional, and do not earn any money for doing this. Likewise, this being a hobby, I probably won't build the site as if I depend on it—rather, I'll do it for fun and writing potentially useful content for passersby to read and spend time on.</p>
		<h3>Technical Information</h3>
		<p>This website is entirely static and has been manually typed. The design/aesthetic is subject to change at any point.</p>
		<p>Personally, I've come to like the aesthetic of a plain (ish) HTML website.</p>
		<p>This entire site is about <i>2.6 MB</i> on its host. But that doesn't mean your browser downloads 2.6 MB each time you visit. Using a site measuring tool, Elaboraet only stores about <i>68.0 KB</i> (more or less; may vary) on first visit to the homepage, indicating that only 68 kilobytes are being requested on first visit to the homepage.</p>
		<p>To make all of this sound even better, browsers <b>cache</b> website data so the information isn't downloaded each time and can be reused, saving time and bandwidth. On small, static websites like this, speed goes through the roof!</p>
		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>I have my email embedded into the "E-MAIL" button below if you want to contact me.</p>

		<p>I don't use (or plan to use) social media.</p>

		<p>If you wanna be a cool person, please don't steal my logo. Thanks.</p>
