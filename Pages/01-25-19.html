			<h1>A Small Review of Roger Scruton's book on Conservatism <a name='Pages:01-25-19'></a></h1>

			<p>
This book was definitely a hard read, but it was a very worthwhile one. While many may be driven away after a quick glance at its title, "Conservatism," — probably having seen a host of shenanigans and stereotypes associated with both the "liberal" and "conservative" labels in American news and media throughout the years — I feel the phrase "Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover" fits perfectly in this case.
</p>

<p>
Scruton's book regards Conservatism, but mostly in its philosophical stance and not its political one (though he does touch on it lightly throughout the book). He goes in-depth into the Conservative philosophy by introducing various historical figures, reviewing or summarizing a few of their works and breakthough ideas and referring back to them throughout the entire book.
</p>

<p>
Interesting to note was his writing style. Deep, detailed, and thorough. The ways in which commas were used were at first confusing — In the beginning of chapter 2, mid-page, the reader comes across this sentence:
</p>

<p>
"The difference in inspiration, trajectory and result between the American and the French revolution is sometimes put down to the greater influence, in the American case, of conservative ways of thinking, compared with the romantic individualism, the desire to pull down the old order and to make everything anew, that inspired the revolutionaries in France."
</p>

<p>
Confusing? I thought the same. That excerpt could've been wound-up into two or more sentences, making it all the easier to read and digest. Shouldn't a writer write clearly and concisely in correspondance with his projected audience if his goal is to send a message for them to act upon? Perhaps his projected audience is perfectly up to the task of deciphering long, comma-tacked sentences. Perhaps I am at fault, here, the one unable to grasp such words of wisdom with my feeble brain?
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong: The ideas and philosophies put forward by Scruton were very reasonable; his presentation of influential philosophers fascinating. The issue above, as well, is perhaps entirely subjective. I don't know.
</p>

<p>
Having finished the book, I would recommend this 100% to those who are interested in philosophy, and just as much to those who are seeking to learn more about the philosophy and origins of the Conservative belief.

Though I don't have a strong preference between the political "left" and "right," I see now that many of the 'conservative' figures shown in popular media, garnering massive attention through YouTube and a few news channels, are little more than celebrities wishing to be celebrities - with flashy statements and explosive arguments. The most reasonable ones, the ones with patient and longlasting arguments, the ones whose books present vital possible solutions to any of our current crises, are the ones whose presence in the popular media of the youth is small, if not nonexistent. This isn't to say "all the reasonable are oppressed," most definitely not, but this is to say that the ones who are the most popular, the ones with the most influence over the youth are the ones with the flashy (usually misleading) idealogues and heavily fallacious or extreme arguments. They are, truly, a far cry from the true conservative philosophy and (perhaps political stance) presented by Scruton.
