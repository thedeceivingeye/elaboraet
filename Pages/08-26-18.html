			<h1>History of Elaboraet <a name='Pages:08-26-18'></a></h1>

			<p>
Months ago, I figured, thinking I should improve my writing skills, that I should start a blog and write to it regularly. After a few minutes of a Google search, my first choice was WordPress.com. This was not a very good idea. Excited, I had clicked through all the dialogs and all the help-popups, created a site icon/favicon, and started rolling. The first issue, however, arose when I visited the site while not logged in to WordPress. A huge banner. It was a huge banner—probably something about 48 pixels tall—at the top of the page that said 'Create your free site today. WordPress.com. Why? To lure in more users. I was definitely not going to be a free-of-charge salesman for WordPress.com, and later deleted my account after a few hours of building the site, though I hadn't written anything to it.
</p>

<p>
If that seems like a short lifespan of a website, I had also tried WordPress.org, the free, self-hosted/open-source variant of WordPress. It didn’t, however, include any hosting plans, and was solely server software to be run on home servers/etc for hosting sites. It was just the website builder software without the ad-banner nonsense. Long story short, I spent another whole day setting up a Raspberry Pi 3 server, installing WordPress server software on Apache, testing it, failing to find a good domain, failing to forward the IP address, and then finally abandoning the site (which was already set up; I just had no idea how to ‘publicize’ it) at some time around midnight.
</p>

<p>
I then came across Google Blogspot. It was perfect at the time. It was technically already set up, had a great site-builder, and even had customization options. For quite a while I was using Blogspot, my site at the time being called ‘Philosophical Insight.’ Later on, I decided I needed a new name. I tried Allure, only then realizing it was also the name of a popular fashion magazine/website. I then tried dumb variations of obscure words. Then I tried Latin words. All the names I came up with seemed to be taken. Either that, or the name sounded like something out of a science fiction novel—I didn’t want that; it looked out of place. I wanted the site to be about critical analysis regarding a wide range of topics, and overall just a hobbyist blog with any topic I desired being written—it was a giant playground of writing. About to give up and keep the old name, I tried one last word, ‘Elaborate.’ Seeing that it looked like a nice logo, too, I intentionally spelled it wrong to give it a sharp angle: Elaboraet. It was perfect--it nicely summed up what I wanted the blogspot to be. — No, not a typo, but a large blog site.
</p>

<p>
However, I didn’t—and still don’t—like Google. (This topic of privacy will probably be covered in another article some time in the future) I was concerned about my privacy, and for being someone who wrote about such topics, I was afraid of appearing a hypocrite. ‘A privacy advocate using Google for hosting his topics? How absurd!’ Days later, I made a backup of all of my written topics, as I did not have external copies of them, and my 3rd and final Google account was deleted that day. (That same day, I managed to quit and delete all of my social media accounts and have never felt better.)
</p>

<p>
The next week, I decided that I should try WordPress.org again, but this time by using a free webhost provider. Once again a long story made short, I found an excellent free domain provider (freenoam.org) that provided me with a .ml domain, I installed WordPress.org on my online CPanel, and was on a roll. The site looked so much better, I called it Elaboraet 2.0 in the 'About' section. But then a problem arose: slow loading times. Some hours, my site was incredibly slow. Other hours, perfectly fine. Seeing that it was quite a shoddy job of a site anyway and didn't take very long to make, I scrapped the project about 4 days later.
</p>

<p>
Since then, and until now, I have not hosted any of my writing and preferred not to run any websites, burnt out from trying so hard for so long. It did not appear that my sites accumulated significant hit counts, anyhow. To me at the time, I came to the conclusion that the entire blogging industry was run by businesses wishing to get attention by writing blogs. I wasn’t a business, nor a startup. I was just some guy at his house trying to find a place to share and improve his writing. No money was going to be involved in such a simple task.
</p>

<p>
Then came the 25th. I found a site called <a href="http://spyware.neocities.org" title="http://spyware.neocities.org" class="http">http://spyware.neocities.org</a>. It was a site that did ‘spyware ratings’ on various software. Or in other words, rated the software based on how ethical it is, whether they are proprietary, etc. For example, a software or service that tracked user interactions for analytics and ads, was closed-source, and also sold userdata would be rated as ‘EXTREMELY HIGH’ on the spyware rating, mainly due to the features closely resembling malicious spyware. Browsing a Reddit thread about/of the site and owner, I saw that someone had remarked, ‘thank you for reminding me NeoCities exists,’ to which I then realized that ‘neocities’ was actually a free hosting site with complete customization and tons of praise. It was open source, too, and is what compelled me to start this new site, this time manually written and with tons of potential; no hosting complications or reliability issues.

As of March 21st, Elaboraet is hosted on Netlify.
