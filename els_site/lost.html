<p>The boy's head scorched with pain as he heard a sound, soft and grand, echo somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p>A few meters in front of him was what looked to be an old, withered tree.</p>

<p>It was a strange place. Lonely and desolate with no one else to be seen. He could make out that this was an island in midst of a vast, gray ocean.</p>

<p>All he knew beyond that was that he had woken up passed-out, laying on a couple of black rocks by the shore. That was hours ago. Here he was now, sitting on pale, wet sand with what remained of his clothes and sanity.</p>

<p>He tried to take a closer look at the withered tree. His blurry sight not helping, he could discern that its bark was peeling and crusted. But despite being faded of color, the tree even held a number of gray leaves. The bark was also overgrown with moss. A strange tree, he thought. It looked as if it had patches of rich, strong bark, but other areas were long gone; faded and crusted.</p>

<p>The sound boomed once again. It sounded like a deep voice. Its words were unintelligible and whatever message it had was short.</p>

<p>There was nothing the boy could do. He couldn't handle it. Where was he? What happened to him, why was he here?</p>

<p>After another moment of uncontrolled shivering, he stood himself up in hopes of walking to the tree. The first time, his legs gave way and he fell to the ground, leaving a small gash on his forehead. He tried again, this time tensing his legs. He stood still like the tree he was aiming for.</p>

<p>A spectator before, he was now a wanderer.</p>

<p>The voice sounded again, reminding the boy of what other mysteries lay at wake. It almost sounded like a person. Its direction, as well, was a bigger mystery.</p>

<p>He shook his head, as if it would clear his confusion. That was a mistake. It begun throbbing once again with the beat of his heart, every second more nauseous and unbearable. For a second, he didn't even know how he was standing.</p>

<p>After what felt like hours, he lifted one foot. Then another. It was easier than he thought.</p>

<p>He made it to the tree and used it as support, leaning on it. Tired as he was, he slumped down to sit and instead used it as a headrest. He closed his stinging, watering eyes.</p>

<p>Just as he'd nearly fallen asleep, he heard the sound again. He opened his eyes and listened.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the direction was now clear. It was coming from afar, deep within the forest. Maybe from the cliffs above them. And in an instant, the wind slowed and the rain calmed.</p>

<p>In this moment, the boy yearned for this freezing rain to quit entirely, for the sun to rise, for him to find his identity. For time to be real again, for his suffering to end. But that wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p>Rupturing the newfound silence, the sound echoed again. The ground shook, though lightly. It sounded angry. Was it his fault? What did he do?</p>

<p>Despite all his mental efforts of recognizing the island, it was an utter shadow. A mystery that had no clues. All he could see was the drab vegetation, aged trees, gritty sand and dark black sky. Behind him an endless chain of harsh, colorless ocean waves.</p>

<p>It was oddly mesmerizing, but painful all the same.</p>

<p>He heard the sound once more. It was happening more frequently, now, but the tone kept changing.</p>

<p>It resembled the caw of a crow, but gutteral, slow and disgusting. These were not the short calls of a normal crow.</p>

<p>The sound, alone, made him shiver harder. He looked toward the perched cliffs as the wind blew into his face.</p>

<p>While at once mesmerizing, this ugly sound and his surroudnings were now terrifying and penetrating, eating away at his soul. If he even had one.</p>

<p>He sat there.</p>

<p>But as quickly as it had slowed, the rain grew abundant and harsh, pouring down with hundreds of millions of impossibly sized drops. Every single one hit and splashed on his skin with a stinging pain. The wind started, too, and was enough to pick the boy off his feet were he to try and stand again. It whirled and twisted, ruining any vegetation. The boy wondered if his tree would stand any longer.</p>

<p>As he looked up, the sky was now a near black and was webbed with splotches of contrasting white. The ocean a darker gray, the cliffs now unmistakably resembled giant, broken teeth on the black, hideous horizon.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare, a hell on earth. The boy, watching, wished he'd already passed out.</p>

<p>But he could not bear the idea of quitting. It was a hellish environment, but he had to go somewhere. Maybe he'd find out more. What a waste, he thought, to sit here and die?</p>

<p>With this plan to walk out further, he slowly pushed himself off the ground. As before, he nearly fell flat on his forehead. But he tried again.</p>

<p>Holding another pace, he limped through the hammering downpour, one foot at a time. Above him a black sky, he squinted another look at his surroundings through the dense fog of downpour. The island was sinister. Big and dark, empty and lifeless.</p>

<p>Though walking, his surroundings looked strikingly familiar. It was a bizarre place. The shattering, splashing rain was deafening. It was the new silence.</p>

<p>He didn't want this nightmare to be the death of him. He had to uncover this mystery.</p>

<p>His chest pained and stung as he trudged atop the sharp rocks. But the rocks, too, were strikingly familiar. He kept walking nonetheless.</p>

<p>The sameness, however, was getting to him: the same rocks, the same grass, the same hunched-over, pale trees. As he turned to look back in confusion, something peculiar happened.</p>

<p>In a flash, his eyes shot open as if he they had been closed the entire time, and he found himself yet again sitting beside that elderly tree.</p>

<p>He clenched his fists and rocketed himself up to stand to walk once more. He didn't care. To try was better than to give up.</p>

<p>And in this moment of despair and frustration, confusion and pain, terror and dread, he forced himself a step forward once again. He returned to walking, but the wind was actively fighting his path.</p>

<p>He darted a glance behind him. Assuredly, he actually moved this time. He was really walking.</p>

<p>But his head gleamed with pain, adding to the hellish, black environment. But this simply didn't matter to him, for he was hopeful. He was walking, and had the potential to go somewhere. Somewhere to fix all of his problems and finally figure out what this island was all about. To uncover the big mystery, to unwrap the shroud.</p>

<p>He cautiously looked up to observe the island once more.</p>

<p>But he couldn't. It was all just blackness. No more were the cracked, black sky and sharp cliffs. The entire island was now enveloped in an insurmountable black silhouette.</p>

<p>He looked back down, but he couldn't see anything there, either. It was just black.</p>

<p>And despite the oddity and terror of the situation, the pain now overtook all his thoughts, jabbing at him from all sides imaginable. He couldn't see where to go. He failed.</p>

<p>He continued his pace with a defying persistence while surpassing what he thought were the limits of his body.</p>

<p>In yet another flash of inexplicable horror, the rain grew completely, indescribably silent. It was all gone, gone as if it were never here, and the wind halted all the same.</p>

<p>With a wreched terror, the boy's eyes could no longer understand the black void of the island. So black, so dark, it begun to blind him.</p>

<p>The extraordinary island was no longer something of this world. It was beyond bizarre, surpassing any and all measure of it.</p>

<p>It was a silent, black void. The boy was catatonic.</p>

<p>In this already blistering, deathly moment, the sound in the distance screeched louder than anything the boy could have ever imagined in his entire life. His already damaged eardrums were now completely disintegrated from its magnitude.</p>

<p>The boy's body fell forward, checked-out at last.</p>
